Intro

Help give up smoking!

Two "features" to keep you going:

- "Celebrate" something every day.
- Track how much you've saved.

I originally wrote this in Python, but have since converted
it to a [JavaScript version](https://github.com/ayeseeem/anniversary-js), and then used it to create a website where you can see it working live:
<https://anniversary.firebaseapp.com/index.html>.

It used to try to track how much I'd saved, and I tried to make it let me
"celebrate" something most days: "it's been 10 days", "it's been two weeks",
"it's been a month", and so on, so there was always a little milestone or
achievement.

The idea was always to improve this, to make it useful for others, either
for giving up smoking, or for some other thing that needs celebrating.
Never quite got round to that! But see the TODOs or issues at the
[new version](https://github.com/ayeseeem/anniversary-js).
